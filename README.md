# BOOTSTRAP-PORTFOLIO

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is my second version of the bootcamp portffolio, I expect to save my work during the bootcamp here to later on show my skills to possible employers.

In this product I have use mainly HTML and Bootstrap to create it and a bit of CSS, thanks to Bootstrap the styling has been superior to our previous version with vainilla CSS and easier to make it responsive too different viewports.

The main challenge here again was to make it responsive as I still dont got clear many things about margins and different types of sizes as could be REM's.
